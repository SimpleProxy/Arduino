  Hello there!

  This repo is meant to be home of some of my humble scripts that help me 
  in my everyday usage of Linux.
  Nothing to awe someone, just me trying to learn.
  
  Brief descriptions of the scripts:

  -  autostart      : starts every desktop program needed right after login
  -  bar            : starts polybar with its configuration file
  -  hkreload       : restarts sxhkd
  -  kblayer        : sets the keybord layout
  -  qed            : quick edit configuration files that are often changed
  -  randomize-bg   : sets and cycle desktop wallpapper
  -  reader         : search and open pdf files
  -  seed.sh        : outputs a random sequence of chacters and numbers
  -  shut           : little menu to poweroff, halt, reboot or suspend
  -  tec            : translate DOS line feed to UNIX line feed
  -  notifyfifo.sh  : send a signal to a fifo
  -  usblistener.sh : listen to a fifo and notify when signal received
